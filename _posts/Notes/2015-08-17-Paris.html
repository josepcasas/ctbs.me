It has been 50 days since I arrived in Paris. I have been to distracted to write anything.


Impressions on Paris

:“If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.”:
― Ernest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast
