There is <a href="http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/0446561754/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&creativeASIN=0446561754&linkCode=as2&tag=ctbs-21)">this book</a> by Meg Jay, a psychologist, arguing the twenties to be the most important decade of a person's life. This makes a lot of sense since before we are 20 our life is very determined by parents and school and once we become 30 we have many other responsibilities (i.e. family, careers) that prevent us from doing big changes in our life. Basically, in ten years we go from being a white page where everything is possible to having an outline written on stone in stone that must be completed. </br></br>

In my case, I am about to finish graduate school and start "real life" once and for all. Given my current situation, it seems reasonable to set some goals, both professional and personal, that will define who I become in the near (and not so near) future. The aim of this list is to help me (#1) become a better human being and (#2) make sure I do the kind of things I've always wanted to do but I always put off because of procrastination. </br></br>

I particularly like the idea of setting 101 goals in 1001 days (almost 3 years). It gives me the opportunity of setting both small goals as some medium term ones, as well as giving a more long run view of them than by setting yearly ones. I plan on officially starting this list the day after I am done with my last exam (this is Saturday 27th May 2015). Therefore, it will run until  Saturday, 24th March 2018. </br></br>

(this is a working progress list and will be continually updated until 27th May)
