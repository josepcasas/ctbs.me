Upon landing at José Martí International Airport in Havana[^1] one can see the triumph of "la revolución": out of 10 staff members 9 are idle and 1 is working. The airport, much like the rest of the city, is worn down by the heartless passing of time. It is dedicated to José Martí, a Cuban national hero and one of the first advocates of Cuban independence from Spain. 

We arrive late at night, tired from a long flight and head to our hotel Occidental Miramar, in the Quinta Avenida ("Fifth Avenue"). It is a It is late and we are jet-lagged, so we go to bed.

We wake up early and head to breakfast. Food is abundant for tourist. 

The similarities between Cuba and its imperialistic enemy are striking. Havana has a Capitolio that tries to replicate the one in Washington D.C.

[^1]: Havana is spelled with v in English while Spanish uses a b, i.e. Habana. Does anyone know the reason for this?
